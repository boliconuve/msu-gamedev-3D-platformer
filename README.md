# S.P.A.C.E. Vault - 3D platformer
I have created a 3D platformer game made in Unity 3D.

My main goal with this project is to learn and apply art, design and programming concepts. I made this approach to grow my knowledge within my chosen discipline, while art, design and code come together to make a game. To become a better game developer.

# The expecificts concepts I have learned:
  - Creating 3D games in Unity.
  - Using ProGrids package to help in level layout and design.
  - Using ProBuilder to help in "whiteboxing" levels (AKA, level design prototyping).
  - Understanding a bit about 3D modeling concepts such as faces, vertices, extruding, and edge loops (using ProBuilder).
  - Practicing a typical level design pipeline from whiteboxing to an art pass.

# Other concepts I have also learned:
  - Reemphasizing good coding practices such as creating and following a coding standard.
  - Learn to create particle effects.
  - Understanding ad hoc programming vs. generalized programming.
  - Be exposed to more complex game systems.
